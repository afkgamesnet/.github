This GitHub organization is the central space of all our techical accomplishments. Inside here all of our plugins, webservices and service workers are planned and getting worked on.

If you have further interest in our techical stack don't mind to visit our [discord](https://discord.gg/d5vKBV8KYA). On there we're sharing a detailed changelog of our systems and you can feel free to ask in our text-channels for more information.

If you're interested in a technical cooperation or in applying to work as a staff member, please don't hesitate to contact us directly via [X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/afkgamesnet) direct messages.
